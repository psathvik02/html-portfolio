<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development and full-stack
engineering. Over the past few years, I have developed skills in web and mobile app development, particularly using
Flutter and Firebase, and I recently built a complete e-commerce application as part of my internship. Alongside
development, I am continuously strengthening my foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to prepare for
placements and technical roles.</p>

<p>My professional journey also includes experience in Market Research and Project Planning in Artificial Intelligence,
where I gained exposure to analyzing technology-driven opportunities and structuring project workflows. Currently, I am
expanding my expertise into SAP Production Planning (PP), combining both software development and enterprise solutions
knowledge.</p>
<hr>
<p>Beyond technical skills, I am deeply curious about computer networks, system design, and architecture, and I enjoy
exploring how technology connects with larger systems such as engineering, physics, and geopolitics. My long-term goal
is to grow as a developer and problem solver, while also contributing to technology-driven solutions and
entrepreneurship that create impact on a broader scale.</p>
